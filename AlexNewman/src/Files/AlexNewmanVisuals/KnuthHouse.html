        <p>

            David Knuths most famous work called "The Art of Computer Programming",which is a seven volume work that was published from 1968-1973. In 1974 he won the Turing Award due to his book. <br>
            The books covered many parts of Computer Science but he won the award for their contribution to the analysis of algorithms.<br>
            Maybe even more famously though David Knuth used to give $2.56 for anyone that would find typing errors within his books, and this is because 256 pennies are 1 hexadecimal dollar.<br>
